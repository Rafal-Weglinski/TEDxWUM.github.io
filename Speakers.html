Two women who dared to break the silence about the menstrual cycle in Poland. Aware of the consequences of a lack of basic knowledge on sexual health they educate both women and men through social media. During their TEDx speech, they will share with us various histories of menarches, inform us about the scope of period poverty, and tell us more about the shame linked to menstruation.
